## Timeline

For our search-volume-over-time endpoint, we support 5 years of data, with weekly datapoints. For longer timline datasets, or for daily or monthly datapoints please reach out to us at [hello@meetglimpse.com](mailto:hello@meetglimpse.com.).

## Geography

All Glimpse API endpoints support filtering the results by a `geo` parameter, consisting of the two-letter country code, as defined by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. [Here you can find a list of all available countries and their corresponding codes. ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12S2j9CEeHyXFA8gohcrArSk8BBP8_soi/view?usp=sharing)

When no geo parameter is specified, worldwide data is returned.

## Phrase Match

Our endpoints all support the use a query parameter called "_phrase match_". To demonstrate what this means, we'll use the keyword "keto diet" as an example.

When _phrase match_ is set to true, the data will reflect activity for any search containing "keto diet", including searches with other words to the left and/or right, like "what is keto diet" or "keto diet recipes".

When _phrase match_ is set to false, the data will reflect activity for any search that contains both "keto" AND "diet", but not necessarily in that order.

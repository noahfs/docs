title: "Phrase Match"
---

Most of our APIs use a query parameter called "*phrase match*". To demonstrate what this means, we'll use the keyword "keto diet" as an example.

When *phrase match* is set to true, the data will reflect activity for any search containing "keto diet", including searches with other words to the left and/or right, like "what is keto diet" or "keto diet recipes".

When *phrase match* is set to false, the data will reflect activity for any search that contains both "keto" AND "diet", but not necessarily in that order.

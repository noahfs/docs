## Why am I seeing slight variations in historical data?

Google Trends uses a sample dataset (a subset of data representing the whole) rather than the entire dataset, a decision explained in its documentation. This leads to faster loading times and keeps costs down.

However, this also means that sometimes when you make the same request after some time has elapsed, the historical data may look ever so slightly different. This difference – and the variance in general – is more visible with lower volume search queries (see the [Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)).

**High-Volume Keyword**

**Medium-Volume Keyword**

\*\*Ultra-Low-Volume Keyword \*\*(\<100 searches per month)

Practically speaking though, there isn’t much cause for concern. The differences between the data are generally in-line with how statistically significant those signals would be.

For example, with the low volume keyword chart above, the data is coming from merely a few dozen searches. With such an exceedingly small sample size, even though the data is drastically different, it doesn't represent a meaningful difference that would even allow allow it to inform any decision-making.

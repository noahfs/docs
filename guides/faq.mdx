## **Does the Glimpse API support Google Trends Topics?**

Yes, in addition to supporting Google Trends' standard keyword queries, we also support Topic queries. If you're not familiar with the concept of Google Trends' Topical keywords, you can read more about it in our [guide to Google Trends](https://meetglimpse.com/google-trends/search-term-vs-topic/). To use them in our API, simply get the topic code from the keyword you want to search. You can find this in the URL of the Google Trends page you're on; it's the string of text that comes after q=

```
trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F04st9hr
```

When unencoded, it'll look like this: _/m/04st9hr_

## Why am I seeing slight variations in historical data?

Google Trends uses a sample dataset (a subset of data representing the whole) rather than the entire dataset, a decision explained in its documentation. This leads to faster loading times and keeps costs down.

However, this also means that sometimes when you make the same request after some time has elapsed, the historical data may look ever so slightly different. This difference – and the variance in general – is more visible with lower volume search queries (see the [Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)).

**High-Volume Keyword**

**Medium-Volume Keyword**

**Ultra-Low-Volume Keyword** (\<100 searches per month)

Practically speaking though, there isn’t much cause for concern. The differences between the data are generally in-line with how statistically significant those signals would be.

For example, with the low volume keyword chart above, the data is coming from merely a few dozen searches. With such an exceedingly small sample size, even though the data is drastically different, it doesn't represent a meaningful difference that would even allow allow it to inform any decision-making.

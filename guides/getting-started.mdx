## **Why Glimpse's API?**

### Other Google Trends APIs show malformed data

Accurately gathering Google Trends data is challenging so it's no surprise that the majority of providers are unwilling to guarantee that their data is not malformed. Below are examples of what this typically looks – non-zero datapoints are randomly replaced with zeros.

We're proud to report that over the past 1 million API calls, Glimpse has returned no malformed data.

### **Other Search Volume APIs are not accurate nor precise**

Glimpse's search volume data is designed to align with Google Trends. If Google Trends shows one keyword having twice the volume of another keyword, you can expeect that same relationship between the search volumes of the two keywords as returned by the Glimpse API.

### **Other search volume APIs have multi-month delays**

Other providers have significant, often multi-month delays. For example, [this third-party case study ](https://www.sara-taher.com/case-study-seo-for-trending-topics/)shows how in January 2023, top search volume tools like Semrush, showed searches for "ChatGPT" as having zero volume yet it'd already been featured on the front of the New York Times, in [every other major newspaper](https://muckrack.com/trends/report/?terms=%22chatgpt%22&daterange_starts=2021-06-01&daterange_ends=2025-04-24), and mentioned over half a million times on Reddit and Twitter. Their tool even shows 273M results for the term "chatpgpt" yet zero search volume:

On the other hand, Google Trends detected ChatGPT’s spike in interest in real-time, down to the minute. Because Glimpse's data is designed to align with Google Trends, any spikes that show up in Google Trends are reflected in Glimpse's data.
